    âœ… VENUE DUPLICATE MANAGEMENT PREPARATION COMPLETE!

    ðŸ“Š SUMMARY:
    - Found 52 sets of duplicate venues that need manual resolution
    - Created venue_merge_logs table for tracking merge operations
    - Added soft delete columns to venues table
    - Created potential_duplicate_venues view for easy duplicate identification
    - Added performance indexes for duplicate management

    ðŸ”§ NEXT STEPS:
    1. Build duplicate review interface (Task 4) to resolve the 52 duplicate sets
    2. Once duplicates are resolved, run a follow-up migration to add unique constraints
    3. Test the constraint enforcement on clean data
