    âœ… VENUE DUPLICATE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CREATED!

    ðŸ“Š INFRASTRUCTURE:
    - Added soft delete columns (deleted_at, deleted_by, merged_into_id) to venues
    - Created venue_merge_logs table for audit trail
    - Added performance indexes
    - Set up structure for potential_duplicate_venues view

    ðŸ”§ DESIGN NOTES:
    - No foreign key constraints to avoid production import conflicts
    - View creation deferred to avoid pg_restore conflicts
    - Referential integrity maintained at application level
    - Unique constraints will be added after duplicate resolution

    ðŸ’¡ NEXT STEPS:
    1. Run: mix create_duplicate_view (to create the duplicate detection view)
    2. Use VenueDuplicateDetector and VenueMergeService to resolve duplicates
    3. Once clean, add unique constraints in a follow-up migration
