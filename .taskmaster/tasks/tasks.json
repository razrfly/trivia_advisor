The migrations now follow Ecto best practices, with proper execution of database queries and correctly referenced unique constraints that align with the ecto_soft_delete convention.

The fix addresses a potential data integrity problem during migration rollbacks by adding an SQL execute statement: `execute \"UPDATE venues SET is_deleted = true WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;\"` after re-adding the `is_deleted` column. This ensures that soft-deleted records properly maintain their deleted status during rollback operations, preventing a scenario where venues marked as deleted would incorrectly appear as active in the system.\n\nWith this fix, all issues identified by Code Rabbit have now been completely resolved:\n1. Column name references properly use `deleted_at IS NULL` instead of `is_deleted = false`\n2. Direct Repo calls have been replaced with `execute/1` for migration compatibility\n3. Hard-coded counts have been replaced with dynamic counting of duplicate sets\n4. The `slug_exists?/1` function now correctly excludes soft-deleted venues\n5. Rollback data integrity is preserved by backfilling the `is_deleted` column from `deleted_at` values\n\nThe implementation now meets all technical quality standards with migrations following Ecto best practices, data integrity preserved in both up and down migrations, successful compilation with no errors, and full readiness for production deployment.\n</info added on 2025-06-18T13:45:48.604Z>",

The service includes transaction-based merge logic using Ecto.Multi to ensure data integrity. Key components implemented include event migration functionality, intelligent metadata conflict detection and merging, and a VenueMergeLog schema for maintaining an audit trail.\n\nCore functions have been successfully verified, including determine_primary_venue/2 which selects the optimal primary venue based on scoring criteria, and preview_merge/3 which generates a preview showing events to be migrated and potential metadata conflicts. The implementation ensures transaction safety through Ecto.Multi for atomic operations and properly integrates with ecto_soft_delete for venue retirement.\n\nTesting with actual duplicate venues (IDs 1332 & 3849 - \"3 Bridges Brewing\") confirmed the functionality works as expected. The system correctly selected venue 1332 as primary, detected one event requiring migration and two metadata conflicts, and recommended a \"review_conflicts\" action.\n\nThe technical implementation includes wrapped database operations in transactions, comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages, multiple metadata merge strategies (prefer_primary, prefer_secondary, combine), batch processing capability for event migration, and thorough audit logging for all merge operations.\n</info added on 2025-06-18T13:55:31.947Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-18T14:02:22.776Z>\nThe VenueMergeService implementation has been completed and thoroughly tested with real venue data. Key updates include:\n\nSchema and changeset modifications were made to the Venue model to properly support the merge process, adding `deleted_by` and `merged_into_id` fields and updating changesets to allow soft-delete fields in cast operations.\n\nFinal testing with actual duplicate venues (2815 & 3569 - \"4 Noses Brewing Company\") confirmed full functionality:\n- Complete merge process executed successfully\n- One event was correctly migrated from the secondary to primary venue\n- Secondary venue was properly soft-deleted with all required metadata (timestamp, deletion attribution, and reference to primary venue)\n- VenueMergeLog entry was created (log_id: 4) maintaining the audit trail\n- Transaction safety was maintained throughout the process using Ecto.Multi\n\nThe implementation is now fully integrated into the Locations context with all five merge functions operational. The code compiles without warnings and has been validated with real production data, making the VenueMergeService fully operational and ready for deployment.\n</info added on 2025-06-18T14:02:22.776Z>",

Modify scraper workflow:\n   - Before creating a new venue, check for potential duplicates\n   - If high-confidence match found, use existing venue\n   - If medium-confidence match, flag for review\n   - Log all decisions for later analysis\n\n2. Implementation steps:\n   - Create ScraperDuplicateHandler class\n   - Inject VenueDuplicateDetector service\n   - Add configuration for confidence thresholds\n   - Implement decision logic for different confidence levels\n\n3. Handle edge cases:\n   - Incomplete venue data from scrapers\n   - Multiple potential matches\n   - Conflicting information\n\nExample implementation:\n```python\nclass ScraperDuplicateHandler:\n    def __init__(self, duplicate_detector, venue_repo, logger, config=None):\n        self.detector = duplicate_detector\n        self.venue_repo = venue_repo\n        self.logger = logger\n        self.config = config or {\n            'high_confidence': 0.95,  # Auto-use existing venue\n            'medium_confidence': 0.85  # Flag for review\n        }\n        \n    async def process_venue(self, venue_data):\n        # Check if this might be a duplicate\n        potential_matches = await self.find_potential_duplicates(venue_data)\n        \n        if not potential_matches:\n            # No duplicates, create new venue\n            return await self.create_new_venue(venue_data)\n            \n        # Find best match\n        best_match = max(potential_matches, key=lambda m: m['score'])\n        \n        if best_match['score'] >= self.config['high_confidence']:\n            # High confidence - use existing venue\n            self.logger.log_detection(\n                best_match['venue'].id, \n                None,  # No ID for new venue yet\n                best_match['score'],\n                best_match['criteria']\n            )\n            return {\n                'action': 'use_existing',\n                'venue_id': best_match['venue'].id,\n                'confidence': best_match['score']\n            }\n            \n        elif best_match['score'] >= self.config['medium_confidence']:\n            # Medium confidence - create but flag for review\n            new_venue = await self.create_new_venue(venue_data)\n            \n            # Flag for review\n            await self.flag_for_review(new_venue.id, best_match['venue'].id, best_match['score'])\n            \n            return {\n                'action': 'flagged',\n                'venue_id': new_venue.id,\n                'potential_duplicate': best_match['venue'].id,\n                'confidence': best_match['score']\n            }\n            \n        else:\n            # Low confidence - create new venue\n            return await self.create_new_venue(venue_data)\n            \n    async def find_potential_duplicates(self, venue_data):\n        # Create temporary venue object for comparison\n        temp_venue = Venue(**venue_data)\n        \n        # Find potential duplicates\n        existing_venues = await self.venue_repo.find_all()\n        return self.detector.find_potential_duplicates(temp_venue, existing_venues)\n        \n    async def create_new_venue(self, venue_data):\n        # Create new venue in database\n        return await self.venue_repo.create(venue_data)\n        \n    async def flag_for_review(self, new_id, existing_id, score):\n        # Add to review queue\n        await self.venue_repo.add_to_review_queue({\n            'venue1_id': new_id,\n            'venue2_id': existing_id,\n            'similarity': score,\n            'status': 'pending',\n            'created_at': datetime.now()\n        })\n        \n        # Log the detection\n        self.logger.log_detection(new_id, existing_id, score)\n```",
